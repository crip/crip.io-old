## Johnie Hjelm

I am a firm believer in well crafted design that stands the test of time, meaning everything I create is thought out, nurtured and cared for to make sure that it is the best possible product I can produce.

I love what I do. Helping companies improve their business through web development and branding. No matter the size of a project, I deliver with great enthusiasm and passion. I work with agile methods, resulting in active and healthy relationships with our clients. I donâ€™t blindly follow a recipe. I break it down into the ingredients, add a few spices and cook not only what you want, but what you need.
